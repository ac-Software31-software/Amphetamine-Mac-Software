## 🧩 Overview  

Amphetamine for macOS is an intelligent utility that gives you complete control over when your computer stays awake. Designed with precision and ease of use in mind, it ensures your Mac never sleeps unexpectedly during important tasks like video rendering, file transfers, coding sessions, or virtual meetings.  

Instead of adjusting power settings manually, Amphetamine lets you create customizable “wake sessions” that keep your Mac active under specific conditions. You can choose to keep the system awake indefinitely, for a specific time, or automatically while certain apps or processes are running. This flexibility makes it a perfect companion for professionals who need reliable uptime.  

Its compact and elegant menu bar interface provides instant control with just one click. Beyond that, users can set up automation triggers — for example, activating a session when a download starts or when a particular app opens. This automation makes Amphetamine not only convenient but also adaptive to your workflow.  

The app runs quietly in the background, using minimal system resources and battery power. It’s fully optimized for Apple Silicon processors and integrates beautifully with macOS notifications, system permissions, and scripting tools such as AppleScript.  

Whether you’re a developer monitoring server logs, a creative professional exporting media, or a user who simply wants to stop their Mac from sleeping during a presentation, Amphetamine ensures uninterrupted performance without compromising energy efficiency.
